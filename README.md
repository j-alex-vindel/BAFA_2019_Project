# British American Football Association (Season 2019)

### This is the code that supports the web application that showcases the DEA of the results of season 2019.

### The work here is the result of a hobby project where web scrappers were built to gather data from the different teams and divisions that conform BAFA.

### The application can be accessed [here](https://bafa-2019-project-jav.streamlit.app) 

### On the left-hand side of the page, there's a bar with options to access different pages.

- [Introduction](https://bafa-2019-project-jav.streamlit.app/Introduction) -> gives a brief introduction about what is BAFA
- [Data Collection](https://bafa-2019-project-jav.streamlit.app/Data_Collection) -> a summary of what data was collected and what questions I am looking to answer
- [Findings](https://bafa-2019-project-jav.streamlit.app/Findings) -> collection of interesting finds from the data 
- [Dashboard](https://bafa-2019-project-jav.streamlit.app/Dashboard) -> an interactive dashboard that can be manipulated through the options on the left-hand side of the page. Just changes the setting and press the "query" button to check graphs.
